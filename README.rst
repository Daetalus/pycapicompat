 pycapicompat.h - Extra CAPI functions for compatibility between various C-based Python implementations
========================================================================================================

`pycapicompat.h` is a C-header with additional CAPI functions providing unified
access to C-based functionality between various C-bases Python implementations.
Currently covered are:

- Pyston_
- CPython_

we would also be glad to cover PyPy_ and we will try to do so on a best effort basis.
Patches are, as always, welcome.
